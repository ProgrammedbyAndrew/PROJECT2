Project 2 

The new library we are using for this project includes gulp.js which is a build tool in JavaScript built on node streams. 
These streams facilitate the connection of file operations through pipelines.
It can be configured either to modify the original files or to create new ones. This grants the ability to perform complex tasks through linking its numerous plugins. 
Gulp is a build system which means apart from running tasks, it is also capable of copying files from one location to another, compiling, deploying, creating notifications, unit testing, linting, etc.
